# Distance Calculation Update

## Overview
Updated the cab booking system to use real-time distance calculation from Google Maps API instead of relying solely on predefined distance matrices.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Updates (Booking.jsx)

1. **Real-time Distance Calculation**
   - Integrated Google Maps Distance Matrix API for accurate distance calculation
   - Added loading state during distance calculation
   - Implemented fallback to predefined distance matrix if Google Maps API fails

2. **Enhanced User Experience**
   - Added visual indicators for distance calculation status
   - Shows source of distance data (Google Maps vs fallback)
   - Real-time fare updates based on calculated distance

3. **Improved Form Validation**
   - Validates that distance and fare are calculated before allowing booking
   - Better error handling for API failures

### Backend Updates (bookingController.js)

1. **Flexible Distance Handling**
   - Accepts distance and fare from frontend
   - Falls back to backend calculation if frontend data is missing
   - Stores location coordinates for future reference

2. **Enhanced Booking Model**
   - Added `pickupCoordinates` and `dropoffCoordinates` fields
   - Better data structure for location tracking

## Features

### ✅ Real-time Distance Calculation
- Uses Google Maps Distance Matrix API
- Calculates actual driving distance between pickup and dropoff locations
- Updates fare automatically based on real distance

### ✅ Fallback Mechanism
- If Google Maps API is unavailable, uses predefined distance matrix
- Ensures system works even without internet connectivity
- User is notified when fallback is used

### ✅ Visual Feedback
- Loading indicator during calculation
- Clear indication of distance source (Google Maps vs fallback)
- Real-time fare display with distance information

### ✅ Error Handling
- Graceful handling of API failures
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic fallback to estimated distances

## Technical Implementation

### Google Maps Integration
```javascript
const service = new window.google.maps.DistanceMatrixService();
service.getDistanceMatrix({
  origins: [{ lat: pickupLocation.lat, lng: pickupLocation.lng }],
  destinations: [{ lat: dropoffLocation.lat, lng: dropoffLocation.lng }],
  travelMode: window.google.maps.TravelMode.DRIVING,
  unitSystem: window.google.maps.UnitSystem.METRIC,
}, callback);
```

### Fare Calculation
```javascript
const baseFare = FARE_PER_KM[cabType] || 10;
let fare = distanceInKm * baseFare;
if (includeReturn) fare *= 2;
fare = Math.round(fare);
```

### Fallback Distance Matrix
```javascript
const DIST_MATRIX = {
  'TV Center': [0, 4, 7, 6, 8, 10],
  'CIDCO': [4, 0, 3, 2, 5, 7],
  // ... more locations
};
```

## Usage

1. **User selects pickup location** using Google Places autocomplete
2. **User selects dropoff location** using Google Places autocomplete
3. **User selects cab type** (Mini, Sedan, SUV, Luxury)
4. **System automatically calculates** distance and fare using Google Maps API
5. **If Google Maps fails**, system falls back to predefined distances
6. **User sees real-time updates** of distance and estimated fare
7. **User can proceed with booking** once calculation is complete

## Benefits

- **Accurate Pricing**: Real-time distance calculation ensures fair pricing
- **Better UX**: Users see immediate feedback on distance and fare
- **Reliability**: Fallback mechanism ensures system always works
- **Scalability**: Can handle any location, not just predefined ones
- **Transparency**: Users know the source of distance calculation

## Future Enhancements

- Add traffic-aware routing for more accurate ETAs
- Implement dynamic pricing based on demand
- Add route visualization on map
- Store historical distance data for analytics
- Add support for multiple waypoints
